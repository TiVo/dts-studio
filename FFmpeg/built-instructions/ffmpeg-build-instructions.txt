Building openh264:
==================

1. Cloned the tag v2.3.1 of openh264 from https://github.com/cisco/openh264.git

2. Launch a command prompt and run the following command:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64

3. Built openh264 with the following command:
make.exe -i OS=msvc  ARCH=x86_64 USE_ASM=Yes BUILDTYPE=Release

4. Installed openh264 to a custom dir:
make.exe -i OS=msvc  ARCH=x86_64 USE_ASM=Yes BUILDTYPE=Release DESTDIR=<custom_dir> install

Building ffmpeg:
================

0. Prerequisites: msys-2 from http://www.mingw.org/

1. Download FFmpeg 4.4.3 from https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-4.4.3.tar.xz

2. Launch a command prompt and run the following command:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64

3. Append the custom dir of opnh264 to the include list with the following command:
set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;<custom_dir>\include
NOTE: vcvarsall.bat already defines the INCLUDE environment variable. This step
appends the include subdirectory of openh264 to the INCLUDE environment variable.

4. Append the custom dir of openh264 to the lib list with the following command:
set LIB=%LIB%;<custom_dir>\lib
NOTE: vcvarsall.bat already defines the LIB environment variable. This step
appends the lib subdirectory of openh264 to the LIB environment variable.

5. Launch an MSYS2 shell with:
"C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd" -full-path
This opens a new MSYS2 shell and inherits all the environment variables of vcvarsall.bat
and those modified by us. All the following steps will be run in this new window.

6. Append the custom dir openh264 to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:<custom_dir>/lib/pkgconfig
NOTE: be sure to use forward slashes instead of backslashes. For example,
if <custom_dir> used before was C:\Dir1\openh264, now you must use
/c/Dir1/openh264

7. Decompress the ffmpeg-4.4.3.tar.xz archive to a directory with
tar xJf ffmpeg-4.4.3.tar.xz.

8. Change the current directory to the one created by the archive decompression.

9. Make a build subdirectory with
mkdir build-windows-x64
And change the working directory to build-windows-x64

10. Configure the build with the following command:
../configure --prefix=/mingw64 --arch=x86_64 --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-asm --enable-libopenh264 --enable-mediafoundation --toolchain=msvc

11. Build ffmpeg with the following command:
make -j <num_cpu> -O
NOTE: the -O parameter is useful only for make versions greater than 4.0. For multi-threaded
builds, it keeps together the messages of various commands.
